# Vim Installation Script

I created this script to configure Vim in a new system. The configuration is simple, and you can choose from two color themes: Gruvbox and Dracula.

## Planned Improvements
1. Support more package managers (Zypper, snap, flatpak), and also allow the user to choose which package manager they wish to use.
2. Make the script more dynamic, allowing the user to specify things like tabstop, shiftwidth, and themes.

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the script's location.
3. Run the script using the following command: `./script.sh`
